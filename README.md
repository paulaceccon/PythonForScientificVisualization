# PythonForScientificVisualization
A set of Python scripts developed to facilitate some scientific visualizations. Most of them was derived from needs that I faced and questions that I asked in StackOverflow.

- **colorbar_custom_limits**: Draws a plot showing a colorbar with custom limits.
- **glyphs_commom_properties**: Draws a plot composed by glyphs; properties are common for the glyphs.

- **glyphs_unique_properties**: Draws a plot composed by glyphs; properties are unique for each glyph.

- **LIC/lic_demo**: Improve resolution when the vector field is not enough discretized.
